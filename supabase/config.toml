# Cron job configuration for scheduled Edge Functions
# This schedules the fetchDeviceCatalog function to run bi-weekly (every 14 days)
# Adjust the schedule as needed using cron syntax
# Example: "0 2 * * 0" = Every Sunday at 2 AM
# Example: "0 2 */14 * *" = Every 14 days at 2 AM

# Uncomment and adjust the schedule as needed
# schedule = "0 2 */14 * *"  # Every 14 days at 2 AM UTC

# Note: Cron scheduling may need to be configured in your Supabase dashboard
# instead of this config file, depending on your Supabase hosting setup.
# Check the Supabase documentation for the latest cron configuration method.
